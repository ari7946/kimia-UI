# React Components with Tailwindcss
![Tailwind-Kit](https://res.cloudinary.com/beloved/image/upload/v1612391435/Assets/kimia_d8zp9s.png)

## Why using Kimia-UI?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. Il allows you writing your style without leaving your HTML.

The biggest disadvantage of tailwindcss is the risk of having too long classes that will make our code not readable enough.

As React is component-based, we can extract component logic with its classes and reuse them elsewhere which will result in more readable code with more components and less classes.

That's why I created this collection of React components with Tailwindcss strictly typed with Typescript which allows you to focus on using the component. It's fully customizable.

## Browser Support

These components are compatible with all browsers
