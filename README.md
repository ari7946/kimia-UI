# UI Components for React built with Tailwind CSS
![Kimia-UI](https://res.cloudinary.com/beloved/image/upload/v1618040187/Assets/kimia_lpqdlr.png)

## Why this approach?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. Il allows you writing your style without leaving your HTML.

The biggest disadvantage of Tailwind CSS is the risk of having too long classes that will make our code not readable enough.

As React is component-based, we can extract component logic with its classes and reuse them elsewhere which will result in more readable code with more components and fewer classes.

That's why I have created this collection of UI components fully customizable. Just copy and paste a component you want to use

All the components are in the **packages** directory.

Each component contains 2 sub-directories
* **examples** : contains examples for each variant of the component in TypeScript
  

* **snippets** : contains examples for each variant  of the component in plain React

## Browser Support

These components are compatible with all browsers
